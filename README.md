# TrackIt
For financial institutions, the risk of credit default is one of the main concerns. These entities use dynamic risk prediction using existing algorithms, which are subject to improvement. However, the data used over time on the characteristics of each consumer in some cases are limited, thus affecting the prediction. Track It is a tool proposed by the students based on the economic model proposed by Paula Beltr√°n Saavedra Ph.D. Which through a system that integrates grouping and prediction algorithms seeks to generate a forecast in the payment behavior of an individual. Compared to traditional systems, this tool makes use of the variation in the day of payment of the financial obligation, together with the prediction of the probability of a consumer's refund where their actions are identified which would be similar to those of those consumers with similar characteristics and transaction records.
